SnmpReqest
==========

SnmpRequest class to simplify the implementation of snmp GET\GETNEXT\GETBULK\GETTABLE

we want to create a project based on snmp4j to monitor devices including host\network\storage devices, SnmpRequest, this
class is written based on snmp4j to send snmp get\getnext\getbulk\gettable request and get the response.
though basic function is implemented, there're too many performance considerations to be solved.

And, we want to explore how far we can go based on snmp relevant information. that's the most point.
